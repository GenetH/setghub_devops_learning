# Deploying Applications Into Kubernetes Cluster

In this project, you will build upon your knowledge of Kubernetes architecture, and begin to deploy applications on a K8s cluster. Kubernetes has a lot of moving parts; it operates with several layers of abstraction between your application and host machines where it runs. So many terms, and capabilities that is not realistic to learn it all at once. Hence, you will be introduced to as many concepts as possible, but gradually.

Within this project we are going to learn and see in action the following:

1. Deployment of software applications using [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) manifest files with following K8s objects:

- Pods
- ReplicaSets
- Deployments
- StatefulSets
- Services (ClusterIP, NodeIP, Loadbalancer)
- Configmaps
- Volumes
- PersistentVolumes
- PersistentVolumeClaims
...and many more

2. Difference between __stateful__ and __stateless__ applications

- Deploy MySQL as a StatefulSet and explain why

3. Limitations of using manifests directly to deploy on K8s

- Working with [Helm](https://helm.sh/) templates, its components and the most important parts - semantic versioning
Converting all the `.yaml` templates into a helm chart

4. Deploying more tools with Helm charts on AWS Elastic [Kubernetes Service (EKS)](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/)

- Jenkins -MySQL -Ingress Controllers (Nginx)
- Cert-Manager
  - Ingress for Jenkins
  - Ingress for the actual application

5. Deploy Monitoring Tools

- Prometheus
- Grafana

6. Hybrid CI/CD by combining different tools such as: [Gitlab CICD](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/), Jenkins. And, you will also be introduced to concepts around [GitOps](https://gitops.weave.works/) using [Weaveworks Flux](https://www.weave.works/oss/flux/).

**Choosing the right Kubernetes cluster set up**

When it comes to using a Kubernetes cluster, there is a number of options available depending on the ultimate use of it. For example, if you just need a cluster for development or learning, you can use lightweight tools like Minikube, or k3s. These tools can run on your workstation without heavy system requirements. Obviously, there is limit to the amount of workload you can deploy there for testing purposes, but it works exactly like any other Kubernetes cluster.

On the other hand, if you need something more robust, suitable for a production workload and with more advanced capabilities such as horizontal scaling of the worker nodes, then you can consider building your own Kubernetes cluster from scratch just as you did in the last Project. If you have been able to automate the entire bootstrap using Ansible, you can easily spin up your nodes with Terraform, and configure the cluster with your Ansible configuration scripts.

It is a great combination of tools responsible for different parts of your applications:

* **Terraform** for infrastructure provisioning
* **Ansible** for cluster master and worker nodes configuration
* **Kubernetes** for deploying your containerized application and orchestrating the deployment process
![AWS Solution](./self_study/images/a.png) 
Other options will be to leverage a **Managed Service** Kubernetes cluster from public cloud providers such as: **AWS EKS**, **Microsoft AKS**, or **Google Cloud Platform GKE**. There are many more options out there. Regardless of whichever one you choose, the experience is usually very similar.

Most organisations choose Managed Service options for obvious reasons such as:

1. Less administrative overheads
2. Reduced cost of ownership
3. Improved Security
4. Seamless support
5. Periodical updates to a stable and well-tested version
6. Faster cluster spin up

... and many more

However, there is usually strong reasons why organisations with very strict compliance and security concerns choose to build their own Kubernetes clusters. Most of the companies that go this route will mostly use on-premises data centres. When there is need to store data privately due to its sensitive nature, companies will rather not use a public cloud provider. Because, if they do, they have no idea of the physical location of the data centre in which their data is being persisted. Banks and Governments are typical examples of this.

Some setup options can combine both public and private cloud together. For example, the master nodes, etcd clusters, and some worker nodes that run **stateful** applications can be configured in private datacentres, while worker nodes that require heavy computations and **stateless** applications can run in public clouds. This kind of hybrid architecture is ideal to satisfy compliance, while also benefiting from other public cloud capabilities.

**Understanding the common YAML fields for every Kubernetes object**

Every Kubernetes object includes object fields that govern the object’s configuration:

* **kind**: Represents the type of Kubernetes object created. It can be a Pod, DaemonSet, Deployments or Service.
* **version**: Kubernetes API version used to create the resource, it can be v1, v1beta and v2. Some of the Kubernetes features can be released under beta and available for general public usage.
* **metadata**: Provides information about the resource like name of the Pod, namespace under which the Pod will be running, labels and annotations.
* **spec**: Consists of the core information about the Pod. Here we will tell Kubernetes what would be the expected state of resource, like container image, number of replicas, environment variables and volumes.
* **status**: Consists of information about the running object, status of each container. Status field is supplied and updated by Kubernetes after creation. This is not something you will have to put in the YAML manifest.

**Deploying a random Pod**

Let's see what it looks like to have a Pod running in a k8s cluster. This section is just to illustrate and get you familiar with how the object's fields work. Let's deploy a basic `nginx` container to run inside a Pod.

* **apiVersion** is v1
* **kind** is Pod
* **metadata** has a name which is set to `nginx-pod`
* **The spec** section has further information about the Pod. Where to find the image to run the container - (This defaults to Docker Hub), the port and protocol.

The structure is similar for any Kubernetes objects, and you will get to see them all as we progress.

1. Create a **Pod** YAML manifest on your master node

```bash
sudo cat <<EOF | sudo tee ./nginx-pod.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - image: nginx:latest
    name: nginx-pod
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
      protocol: TCP
EOF
```
![AWS Solution](./self_study/images/c.png)

**2. Apply the manifest with the help of `kubectl`**

```bash
kubectl apply -f nginx-pod.yaml
```

**Output:**

```
pod/nginx-pod created
```
![AWS Solution](./self_study/images/d.png)

**3. Get an output of the pods running in the cluster**

```bash
kubectl get pods
```
![AWS Solution](./self_study/images/e.png)

**Output:**

```
NAME        READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
nginx-pod   1/1     Running   0          19m
```

**4. If the Pods were not ready for any reason, for example, if there are no worker nodes, you will see something like the below output.**

```
NAME        READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
nginx-pod   0/1     Pending   0          111s
```

**5. To see other fields introduced by Kubernetes after you have deployed the resource, simply run the below command, and examine the output. You will see other fields that Kubernetes updates from time to time to represent the state of the resource within the cluster. `-o` simply means the output format.**

```bash
kubectl get pod nginx-pod -o yaml
```

or

```bash
kubectl describe pod nginx-pod
```
![AWS Solution](./self_study/images/ee.png)
![AWS Solution](./self_study/images/ff.png)

**Accessing the app from the browser**

Now you have a running Pod. What's next?

The ultimate goal of any solution is to access it either through a web portal or some application (e.g., mobile app). We have a Pod with Nginx container, so we need to access it from the browser. But all you have is a running Pod that has its own IP address which cannot be accessed through the browser. To achieve this, we need another Kubernetes object called [Service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/) to accept our request and pass it on to the `Pod`.

A __service__ is an object that accepts requests on behalf of the __Pods__ and forwards it to the Pod's IP address. If you run the command below, you will be able to see the Pod's IP address. But there is no way to reach it directly from the outside world.

```bash
kubectl get pod nginx-pod  -o wide
```
Output:
```
NAME        READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE    IP               NODE                                              NOMINATED NODE   READINESS GATES
nginx-pod   1/1     Running   0          138m   172.50.202.214   ip-172-50-202-161.eu-central-1.compute.internal   <none>           <none>
```
![AWS Solution](./self_study/images/fg.png)

### Let us try to access the Pod through its IP address from within the K8s cluster. To do this,

1. We need an image that already has curl software installed. You can check it out [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/dareyregistry/curl)

```
dareyregistry/curl
```
2. Run kubectl to connect inside the container

```bash
kubectl run curl --image=dareyregistry/curl -i --tty
```
or Run Temporary Pod

```bash
kubectl run curl-pod --image=curlimages/curl:latest --restart=Never -i --tty -- /bin/sh
```

3. Run curl and point to the IP address of the Nginx Pod (Use the IP address of your own Pod)

```bash
curl -v 172.31.43.239:80
```
Output:
```
> GET / HTTP/1.1
> User-Agent: curl/7.35.0
> Host: 172.50.202.214
> Accept: */*

![AWS Solution](./self_study/images/nice.png)

If the use case for your solution is required for internal use ONLY, without public Internet requirement. Then, this should be OK. But in most cases, it is NOT!

Assuming that your requirement is to access the Nginx Pod internally, using the Pod's IP address directly as above is not a reliable choice because Pods are ephemeral. They are not designed to run forever. When they die and another Pod is brought back up, the IP address will change and any application that is using the previous IP address directly will break.

To solve this problem, kubernetes uses __Service__ - An object that abstracts the underlining IP addresses of Pods. A service can serve as a load balancer, and a reverse proxy which basically takes the request using a human readable DNS name, resolves to a Pod IP that is running and forwards the request to it. This way, you do not need to use an IP address. Rather, you can simply refer to the service name directly.

### Let us create a service to access the __Nginx Pod__

1. Create a Service `yaml` manifest file:

```bash
sudo cat <<EOF | sudo tee ./nginx-service.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nginx-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: nginx-pod
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
EOF
```
![AWS Solution](./self_study/images/fs.png)

2. Create a nginx-service resource by applying your manifest

```bash
kubectl apply -f nginx-service.yaml
```
output:
```
service/nginx-service created
```
![AWS Solution](./self_study/images/ym.png)


3. Check the created service

```bash
kubectl get service
```
output:
```
NAME            TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)   AGE
kubernetes      ClusterIP   10.100.0.1      <none>        443/TCP   68d
nginx-service   ClusterIP   10.100.71.130   <none>        80/TCP    85s
```
![AWS Solution](./self_study/images/sv.png)

__Observation:__

The __TYPE__ column in the output shows that there are different [service types](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#publishing-services-service-types).

- ClusterIP
- NodePort
- LoadBalancer &
- Headless Service

Since we did not specify any type, it is obvious that the default type is __ClusterIP__

Now that we have a service created, how can we access the app? Since there is no public IP address, we can leverage `kubectl's` __port-forward__ functionality.

```bash
kubectl  port-forward svc/nginx-service 8089:80
```
__8089__ is an arbitrary port number on your laptop or client PC, and we want to tunnel traffic through it to the port number of the `nginx-service` __80__.

![AWS Solution](./self_study/images/ccc.png)

Unfortunately, this will not work quite yet. Because there is no way the service will be able to select the actual Pod it is meant to route traffic to. If there are hundreds of Pods running, there must be a way to ensure that the service only forwards requests to the specific Pod it is intended for.

![AWS Solution](./self_study/images/uu.png)

To make this work, you must reconfigure the Pod manifest and introduce `labels` to match the `selectors` key in the field section of the service manifest.

1. Update the Pod manifest with the below and apply the manifest:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx-pod
  labels:
    app: nginx-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - image: nginx:latest
    name: nginx-pod
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
      protocol: TCP
```

![AWS Solution](./self_study/images/tc.png)

__Notice__ that under the metadata section, we have now introduced `labels` with a key field called `app` and its value `nginx-pod`. This matches exactly the `selector` key in the __service__ manifest.
The key/value pairs can be anything you specify. These are not Kubernetes specific keywords. As long as it matches the selector, the service object will be able to route traffic to the `Pod`.

Apply the manifest with:

```bash
kubectl apply -f nginx-pod.yaml
```

2. Run kubectl port-forward command again

```bash
kubectl  port-forward svc/nginx-service 8089:80
```
output:
```
kubectl  port-forward svc/nginx-service 8089:80
Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:8089 -> 80
Forwarding from [::1]:8089 -> 80
```

![AWS Solution](./self_study/images/tcc.png)

Then go to your web browser and enter __localhost:8089__ - You should now be able to see the nginx page in the browser.

![AWS Solution](./self_study/images/lo.png)

Let us try to understand a bit more about how the service object is able to route traffic to the Pod.

If you run the below command:

```bash
kubectl get service nginx-service -o wide
```
You will get the output similar to this:
```
NAME            TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)   AGE   SELECTOR
nginx-service   ClusterIP   10.100.71.130   <none>        80/TCP    4d    app=nginx-pod
```
![AWS Solution](./self_study/images/loo.png)

As you already know, the service's type is `ClusterIP`, and in the above output, it has the IP address of __10.100.131.163__ - This IP works just like an internal loadbalancer. It accepts requests and forwards it to an IP address of any Pod that has the respective `selector` label. In this case, it is `app=nginx-pod`. If there is more than one Pod with that label, service will distribute the traffic to all theese pods in a [Round Robin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-robin_scheduling) fashion.

Now, let us have a look at what the Pod looks like:

```bash
kubectl get pod nginx-pod --show-labels
```
Output:
```
NAME        READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE   LABELS
nginx-pod   1/1     Running   0          31m   app=nginx-pod
```
![AWS Solution](./self_study/images/laa.png)

___Notice__ that the IP address of the Pod, is NOT the IP address of the server it is running on. Kubernetes, through the implementation of network plugins assigns virtual IP adrresses to each Pod._

```bash
kubectl get pod nginx-pod -o wide
```
Output:
```
NAME        READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE   IP               NODE                                              NOMINATED NODE   READINESS GATES
nginx-pod   1/1     Running   0          57m   172.50.197.236   ip-172-50-197-215.eu-central-1.compute.internal   <none>           <none>
```
![AWS Solution](./self_study/images/ru.png)

Therefore, Service with IP `10.0.5.211` takes request and forwards to Pod with IP `172.20.179.147`

# Expose a Service on a server's public IP address & static port

Sometimes, it may be needed to directly access the application using the public IP of the server (when we speak of a K8s cluster we can replace 'server' with 'node') the Pod is running on. This is when the [NodePort](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#nodeport) service type comes in handy.

A __Node port__ service type exposes the service on a static port on the node's IP address. NodePorts are in the `30000-32767` range by default, which means a NodePort is unlikely to match a service’s intended port (for example, __80__ may be exposed as __30080__).

Update the nginx-service `yaml` to use a NodePort Service.

```yaml
sudo cat <<EOF | sudo tee ./nginx-service.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nginx-service
spec:
  type: NodePort
  selector:
    app: nginx-pod
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      nodePort: 30080
EOF
```
![AWS Solution](./self_study/images/noo.png)

What has changed is:

- Specified the type of service (Nodeport)
- Specified the NodePort number to use.

![AWS Solution](./self_study/images/no.png)

To access the service, you must:

- Allow the inbound traffic in your EC2's __Security Group__ to the `NodePort` range __30000-32767__
- Get the public IP address of the node the Pod is running on, append the nodeport and access the app through the browser.

Apply the service update

```bash
kubectl apply -f nginx-service.yaml
```
Confirm the node the pod is running on (Check the internal IP address)

```bash
kubectl get pod nginx-pod -o wide
```
![AWS Solution](./self_study/images/sw.png)

You must understand that the port number `30080` is a port on the node in which the Pod is scheduled to run. If the Pod ever gets rescheduled elsewhere, that the same port number will be used on the new node it is running on. So, if you have multiple Pods running on several nodes at the same time - they all will be exposed on respective nodes' IP addresses with a static port number.

![AWS Solution](./self_study/images/waw.png)

Read some more information regarding Services in Kubernetes in this [article](https://medium.com/avmconsulting-blog/service-types-in-kubernetes-24a1587677d6).

## How Kubernetes ensures desired number of Pods is always running?

When we define a Pod manifest and appy it - we create a Pod that is running until it's terminated for some reason (e.g., error, Node reboot or some other reason), but what if we want to declare that we always need at least 3 replicas of the same Pod running at all times? Then we must use a [ResplicaSet (RS)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/replicaset/) object - it's purpose is to maintain a stable set of Pod replicas running at any given time. As such, it is often used to guarantee the availability of a specified number of identical Pods.

__Note:__ In some older books or documents you might find the old version of a similar object - [ReplicationController (RC)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/replicationcontroller/), it had similar purpose, but did not support [set-base label selectors](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/#set-based-requirement) and it is now recommended to use ReplicaSets instead, since it is the next-generation RC.

Let us __delete__ our __nginx-pod Pod__:

```bash
kubectl delete -f nginx-pod.yaml
```
Output:
```
pod "nginx-pod" deleted
```

## Create a ReplicaSet

Let us create a `rs.yaml` manifest for a ReplicaSet object:

```bash
cat <<EOF > rs.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: ReplicaSet
metadata:
  name: nginx-rs
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx-pod
  template:
    metadata:
      name: nginx-pod
      labels:
        app: nginx-pod
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: nginx:latest
        name: nginx-pod
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
          protocol: TCP
EOF
```
![AWS Solution](./self_study/images/rs.png)

```bash
kubectl apply -f rs.yaml
```
The manifest file of ReplicaSet consist of the following fields:

- __apiVersion:__ This field specifies the version of kubernetes Api to which the object belongs. ReplicaSet belongs to __apps/v1__ apiVersion.
- __kind:__ This field specify the type of object for which the manifest belongs to. Here, it is __ReplicaSet__.
- __metadata:__ This field includes the metadata for the object. It mainly includes two fields: name and labels of the ReplicaSet.
- __spec:__ This field specifies the `label selector` to be used to select the Pods, number of replicas of the Pod to be run and the container or list of containers which the Pod will run. In the above example, we are running `3 replicas` of nginx container.

Let us check what Pods have been created:

```bash
kubectl get pods
```
OUTPUT:
```
NAME              READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE     IP               NODE                                              NOMINATED NODE   READINESS GATES
nginx-pod-j784r   1/1     Running   0          7m41s   172.50.197.5     ip-172-50-197-52.eu-central-1.compute.internal    <none>           <none>
nginx-pod-kg7v6   1/1     Running   0          7m41s   172.50.192.152   ip-172-50-192-173.eu-central-1.compute.internal   <none>           <none>
nginx-pod-ntbn4   1/1     Running   0          7m41s   172.50.202.162   ip-172-50-202-18.eu-central-1.compute.internal    <none>           <none>
```
![AWS Solution](./self_study/images/rt.png)

Here we see three `ngix-pods` with some random suffixes (e.g., `-j784r`) - it means, that these Pods were created and named automatically by some other object (higher level of abstraction) such as ReplicaSet.

Try to delete one of the Pods:

```bash
kubectl delete pod nginx-rs-52597
```
You can see, that we still have all 3 Pods, but one has been recreated (can you differentiate the new one?)

Explore the ReplicaSet created:

```bash
kubectl get rs -o wide
```
![AWS Solution](./self_study/images/fgg.png)

__Notice__, that ReplicaSet understands which Pods to create by using __SELECTOR__ key-value pair.

## Get detailed information of a ReplicaSet

To display detailed information about any Kubernetes object, you can use 2 differen commands:

kubectl __describe__ %object_type% %object_name% (e.g. kubectl describe rs nginx-rs)
kubectl __get__ %object_type% %object_name% -o yaml (e.g. kubectl get rs nginx-rs -o yaml)

Try both commands in action and see the difference. Also try `get` with `-o json` instead of `-o yaml` and decide for yourself which output option is more readable for you.

```bash
kubectl describe rs nginx-rs
```
![AWS Solution](./self_study/images/sf.png)

```bash
kubectl get rs nginx-rs -o yaml
```
![AWS Solution](./self_study/images/gen.png)

```bash
kubectl get rs nginx-rs -o json
```
![AWS Solution](./self_study/images/gh.png)

## Scale ReplicaSet up and down

In general, there are 2 approaches of [Kubernetes Object Management](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/object-management/): __imperative__ and __declarative__.

Let us see how we can use both to scale our Replicaset up and down:

### Imperative:

We can easily scale our ReplicaSet up by specifying the desired number of replicas in an imperative command, like this:

```bash
kubectl scale rs nginx-rs --replicas=5
```
Output:
```
replicationcontroller/nginx-rc scaled
```

```bash
kubectl get pods
```
Output:
```
NAME             READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
nginx-rc-4kgpj   1/1     Running   0          4m30s
nginx-rc-4z2pn   1/1     Running   0          4m30s
nginx-rc-g4tvg   1/1     Running   0          6s
nginx-rc-kmh8m   1/1     Running   0          6s
nginx-rc-zlgvp   1/1     Running   0          4m30s
```
![AWS Solution](./self_study/images/scale.png)

Scaling down will work the same way, so scale it down to 3 replicas.

![AWS Solution](./self_study/images/fff.png)

### Declarative:

Declarative way would be to open our `rs.yaml` manifest, change desired number of replicas in respective section.

```yaml
spec:
  replicas: 3
```
and applying the updated manifest:

```bash
kubectl apply -f rs.yaml
```
There is another method - `ad-hoc`, it is definitely not the best practice and we do not recommend using it, but you can edit an existing ReplicaSet with following command:

```bash
kubectl edit -f rs.yaml
```

## Advanced label matching

As Kubernetes mature as a technology, so does its features and improvements to k8s objects. `ReplicationControllers` do not meet certain complex business requirements when it comes to using selectors. Imagine if you need to select Pods with multiple lables that represents things like:

- __Application tier:__ such as Frontend, or Backend
- __Environment:__ such as Dev, SIT, QA, Preprod, or Prod

So far, we used a simple selector that just matches a key-value pair and check only 'equality':

```yaml
selector:
    app: nginx-pod
```

But in some cases, we want ReplicaSet to manage our existing containers that match certain criteria, we can use the same simple label matching or we can use some more complex conditions, such as:

```
- in
- not in
- not equal
- etc...
```
Let us look at the following manifest file:

```bash
cat <<EOF > rs.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: ReplicaSet
metadata:
  name: nginx-rs
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      env: prod
    matchExpressions:
    - { key: tier, operator: In, values: [frontend] }
  template:
    metadata:
      name: nginx
      labels:
        env: prod
        tier: frontend
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx-container
        image: nginx:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
          protocol: TCP
EOF
```
In the above spec file, under the selector, __matchLabels__ and __matchExpression__ are used to specify the key-value pair. The __matchLabel__ works exactly the same way as the equality-based selector, and the matchExpression is used to specify the set based selectors. This feature is the main differentiator between __ReplicaSet__ and previously mentioned obsolete __ReplicationController__.

Get the replication set:

```bash
# Delete the existing ReplicaSet and recreate it (because the selector field is immutable)
kubectl delete rs nginx-rs
kubectl apply -f rs.yaml

kubectl get rs nginx-rs -o wide
```
Output:
```
NAME       DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE     CONTAINERS        IMAGES         SELECTOR
nginx-rs   3         3         3       5m34s   nginx-container   nginx:latest   env=prod,tier in (frontend)
```

## Using AWS Load Balancer to access your service in Kubernetes.

___Note:__ You will only be able to test this using AWS EKS. You don not have to set this up in current project yet. In the next project, you will update your Terraform code to build an EKS cluster._

You have previously accessed the Nginx service through __ClusterIP__, and __NodeIP__, but there is another service type - [Loadbalancer](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#loadbalancer). This type of service does not only create a __Service__ object in K8s, but also provisions a real external Load Balancer (e.g. [Elastic Load Balancer](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/) - ELB in AWS)

To get the experience of this service type, update your service manifest and use the __LoadBalancer__ type. Also, ensure that the selector references the Pods in the replica set.

```bash
sudo cat <<EOF | sudo tee ./nginx-service.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nginx-service
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  selector:
    tier: frontend
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80 # This is the port the Loadbalancer is listening at
      targetPort: 80 # This is the port the container is listening at
EOF
```
![AWS Solution](./self_study/images/loa.png)

Apply the configuration:

```bash
kubectl apply -f nginx-service.yaml
```

Get the newly created service :

```bash
kubectl get service nginx-service
```
Output:
```
NAME            TYPE           CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP                                                                  PORT(S)        AGE
nginx-service   LoadBalancer   10.100.71.130   aab159950f39e43d39195e23c77417f8-1167953448.eu-central-1.elb.amazonaws.com   80:31388/TCP   5d18h
```

This environment variable ensures that the AWS SDK checks both __~/.aws/credentials__ and __~/.aws/config__ files.

An ELB resource will be created in your AWS console.

![AWS Solution](./self_study/images/dns.png)

A Kubernetes component in the control plane called [Cloud-controller-manager](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/cloud-controller/) is responsible for triggeriong this action. It connects to your specific cloud provider's (AWS) APIs and create resources such as Load balancers. It will ensure that the resource is appropriately tagged:

![AWS Solution](./self_study/images/ta.png)

Get the output of the entire `yaml` for the service. You will see additional information about this service in which you did not define them in the `yaml` manifest. Kubernetes did this for you.

```bash
kubectl get service nginx-service -o yaml
```
Output:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  annotations:
    kubectl.kubernetes.io/last-applied-configuration: |
      {"apiVersion":"v1","kind":"Service","metadata":{"annotations":{},"name":"nginx-service","namespace":"default"},"spec":{"ports":[{"port":80,"protocol":"TCP","targetPort":80}],"selector":{"app":"nginx-pod"},"type":"LoadBalancer"}}
  creationTimestamp: "2021-06-18T16:24:21Z"
  finalizers:

  uid: c12145d6-a8b5-491d-95ff-8e2c6296b46c
spec:
  clusterIP: 10.100.153.44
  externalTrafficPolicy: Cluster
  ports:
  - nodePort: 31388
    port: 80
    protocol: TCP
    targetPort: 80
  selector:
    tier: frontend
  sessionAffinity: None
  type: LoadBalancer
status:
  loadBalancer:
    ingress:
    - hostname: ac12145d6a8b5491d95ff8e2c6296b46-588706163.eu-central-1.elb.amazonaws.com
```
![AWS Solution](./self_study/images/tf.png)

1. A __clusterIP__ key is updated in the manifest and assigned an IP address. Even though you have specified a Loadbalancer service type, internally it still requires a clusterIP to route the external traffic through.

2. In the ports section, nodePort is still used. This is because Kubernetes still needs to use a dedicated port on the worker node to route the traffic through. Ensure that port range __30000-32767__ is opened in your inbound Security Group configuration.

3. More information about the provisioned balancer is also published in the .status.loadBalancer field.
    ```yaml
    status:
      loadBalancer:
        ingress:
        - hostname: ac12145d6a8b5491d95ff8e2c6296b46-588706163.eu-central-1.elb.amazonaws.com
    ```
Copy and paste the load balancer's address to the browser, and you will access the Nginx service

## Do not Use Replication Controllers - Use Deployment Controllers Instead

Kubernetes is loaded with a lot of features, and with its vibrant open source community, these features are constantly evolving and adding up.

Previously, you have seen the improvements from __ReplicationControllers (RC)__, to __ReplicaSets (RS)__. In this section you will see another K8s object which is highly recommended over Replication objects (RC and RS).

 ## Deployment

A [Deployment](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/) is another layer above ReplicaSets and Pods, newer and more advanced level concept than ReplicaSets. It manages the deployment of ReplicaSets and allows for easy updating of a ReplicaSet as well as the ability to roll back to a previous version of deployment. It is declarative and can be used for rolling updates of micro-services, ensuring there is no downtime.

Officially, it is highly recommended to use __Deplyments__ to manage replica sets rather than using replica sets directly.

Let us see Deployment in action.

1. Delete the ReplicaSet

```bash
kubectl delete rs nginx-rs
```
2. Understand the layout of the deployment.yaml manifest below. Lets go through the 3 separated sections:

```yaml
# Section 1 - This is the part that defines the deployment
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
  labels:
    tier: frontend

# Section 2 - This is the Replica set layer controlled by the deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      tier: frontend

# Section 3 - This is the Pod section controlled by the deployment and selected by the replica set in section 2.
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        tier: frontend
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

3. Putting them altogether

```bash
cat <<EOF > ./deployment.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
  labels:
    tier: frontend
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      tier: frontend
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        tier: frontend
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
EOF
```
![AWS Solution](./self_study/images/taa.png)

```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```
![AWS Solution](./self_study/images/tz.png)

Run commands to get the following

1. Get the Deployment

```bash
kubectl get deployment
```
```
NAME               READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
nginx-deployment   3/3     3            3           39s
```
![AWS Solution](./self_study/images/de.png)

2. Get the ReplicaSet

```bash
kubectl get rs
```
```
NAME                          DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE
nginx-deployment-56466d4948   3         3         3       24s
```

3. Get the Pods

```bash
kubectl get pods
```
```
NAME                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
nginx-deployment-56466d4948-5zdbx   1/1     Running   0          12s
nginx-deployment-56466d4948-tg9j8   1/1     Running   0          12s
nginx-deployment-56466d4948-ttn5t   1/1     Running   0          12s
```
![AWS Solution](./self_study/images/fr.png)

4. Scale the replicas in the Deployment to 15 Pods

```bash
kubectl scale deployment nginx-deployment --replicas=15
```
![AWS Solution](./self_study/images/mr.png)

5. Exec into one of the Pod's container to run Linux commands

```bash
kubectl exec -it nginx-deployment-56466d4948-78j9c bash
```
List the files and folders in the Nginx directory

```bash
ls -ltr /etc/nginx/
```
![AWS Solution](./self_study/images/bash.png)

Check the content of the default Nginx configuration file

```bash
cat  /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
```
![AWS Solution](./self_study/images/ds.png)

Now, as we have got acquainted with most common Kubernetes workloads to deploy applications:

![AWS Solution](./self_study/images/ik.png)

it is time to explore how Kubernetes is able to manage persistent data.

## Persisting Data for Pods

Deployments are stateless by design. Hence, any data stored inside the Pod's container does not persist when the Pod dies.

If you were to update the content of the `index.html` file inside the container, and the Pod dies, that content will be lost since a new Pod will replace the dead one.

Let us try that:

1. Scale the Pods down to 1 replica.

```bash
kubectl scale deployment nginx-deployment --replicas=1
```
![AWS Solution](./self_study/images/1.png)

2. Exec into the running container (figure out the command yourself)

```bash
kubectl exec -it nginx-deployment-56466d4948-78j9c -- /bin/bash
```
![AWS Solution](./self_study/images/up.png)

3. Install vim so that you can edit the file

```bash
apt-get update
apt-get install vim
```
![AWS Solution](./self_study/images/3.png)

4. Update the content of the file and add the code below __/usr/share/nginx/html/index.html__

```bash
vim /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html
```

```html

5. Check the browser - You should see this

![AWS Solution](./self_study/images/yes.png)

6. Now, delete the only running Pod so that a new one is automatically recreated.

```bash
kubectl delete pod nginx-deployment-56466d4948-tg9j8
```
![AWS Solution](./self_study/images/hj.png)

7. __Refresh the web page__ - You will see that the content you saved in the container is no longer there. That is because Pods do not store data when they are being recreated - that is why they are called `ephemeral` or `stateless`. (_But not to worry, we will address this with persistent volumes in the next project_)

![AWS Solution](./self_study/images/re.png)

__Storage__ is a critical part of running containers, and Kubernetes offers some powerful primitives for managing it. __Dynamic volume provisioning__, a feature unique to Kubernetes, which allows storage volumes to be created on-demand. Without dynamic provisioning, DevOps engineers must manually make calls to the cloud or storage provider to create new storage volumes, and then create __PersistentVolume__ objects to represent them in Kubernetes. The dynamic provisioning feature eliminates the need for DevOps to pre-provision storage. Instead, it automatically provisions storage when it is requested by users.

To make the data persist in case of a Pod's failure, you will need to configure the Pod to use __Volumes__:

__Clean up the deployment__

```bash
kubectl delete deployment nginx-deployment
```
